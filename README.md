# About
ByteCanvas is a cutting-edge technology-themed website offering a streamlined user experience. The homepage features a clean navbar with Brand Names, Advertisements, and Products sections. The Add Product page allows users to effortlessly add detailed product information. Clicking on a brand redirects to a dedicated page showcasing products and advertisements. The product detail route enables users to view comprehensive details and add products to the cart, seamlessly integrated with database storage. A My Cart page provides an overview of added products. The website implements email/password authentication, error displays, and additional login options. Responsive design, a 404 page, and a dark/light theme toggle enhance user interaction.
